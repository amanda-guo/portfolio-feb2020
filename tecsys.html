                        <p class="lead">For the Winter 2020 work term, I worked as a Product Manager at Tecsys. This company specializes in supply chain management. Specifically, I worked in the retail division on the Order Management System (OMS). Along with my role as a Product Manager, I was the lead UI/UX designer on the retail team and embedded design into every decision I made. This was important as our goal was to create features and enhance functionality for the end user of the application. I engaged in various research activities including user research (in the form of surveys and calls with customers), brainstorming sessions to define user personas and analyzing the analytics/quantitative measures of the platform. As a designer, I built a new design system for the application that was focused on consistency and scalability, and wrote up a style guide for this system as well. I established Figma as the primary design tool for the retail platform team and collaborated with developers to bring new designs for the OMS UI to life. I gained a deep understanding of the end user and even initiated the development of a flagging feature to enhance their workflow on the application.</p>
