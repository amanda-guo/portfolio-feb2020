                        <p class="lead">Financial planning is a huge topic that is important for anyone to make sure that they are managing their money in a smart manner. However, this important life skill is not taught in schools. Many students have had to learn financial planning on their own - and many are finding this to be a challenge. While some students are tracking their spending on an excel spreadsheet, others simply do not track it at all. This presents a long term issue where some students are not aware of how to properly budget and manage their money. Others who do attempt to track their spending are not using the proper tools and thus are not realizing the value of budgeting. This is the problem that we tried to tackle.</p>

                  <!--User Research-->

                    <div class="container">
                        <h1>User Research</h1>
                        <hr width=30% align=left>
                        <p class="lead">We interviewed several other students to gain an understanding of how they currently plan their finances. Here are the questions that were asked:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">Is personal financial planning important to you?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">How do you keep track of your spending?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">What tools do you currently use to keep track of your budget?</p>
                         <br>
                        <p class="lead">How often do you track your spending? Monthly? Weekly? Yearly?</p>
                         <br>
                        <p class="lead">The responses we got were pretty surprising. Many younger students actually indicated that they do not track their spending. They simply said that whenever they needed money, they would just ask their parents for it. Budgeting wasn’t an issue that they thought of that much, and they didn’t see a point in tracking their spending.</p>
                         <br>
                        <p class="lead">From this information, we thought that perhaps we were targeting the wrong user segment. That seemed to be the case. When we asked older students, we got the understanding that when they became more independent from their parents, that’s when they started prioritizing financial planning. We also learned that they wanted to see their spending trends by category so they could better plan for the short-term future (on a month-to-month basis).</p>

                        <p class="lead">We started simple and mapped out a straightforward user journey with the wireframes for simple day-to-day recordings of transactions. Then, we included graphs and tracking bars to show progress. The goal of this application is to indicate to a user their spending trends and allow them to adjust their budget for certain categories based on their financial goals. We wanted to target the core of financial planning, which is planning for a sustainable future and showing a user what they need to buy vs. what they want to buy. We took inspiration from other applications in the industry as well. For example, we looked at what makes Mint an effective budgeting tool.</p>

This involved minimalistic styles and straightforward actions. We also used a dark mode theme because research has shown that a dark mode is much easier on the eyes. Since users are on their phones for a large majority of the day, we wanted to help ease the strain on their eyes as they are using our application as well.
