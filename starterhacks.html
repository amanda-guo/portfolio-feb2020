StarterHacks is Canada’s largest beginner-friendly hackathon based at the University of Waterloo. I worked with a team of 6 other Market Designers, as well as Product Designers to create graphics that were released to over 2500 potential hackers.</p>

                <!--Responsibilities and Challenges-->

                <div class="padding">
                    <div class="container">
                        <h1>Responsibilities and Challenges</h1>
                        <hr width=50% align=left>
                        <p class="lead">We worked both remotely and in person to complete a variety of design projects. Notably some of the larger ones included designing the Sponsorship Package, establishing the StarterHacks 2020 branding for the upcoming year and designing marketing/graphic material. Our primary tools included Figma and Adobe Illustrator. Our main communication platform was Slack and we scheduled weekly meetings for tasks. </p>
                        <p class="lead">One of our biggest challenges and successes of the year was establishing a new brand. This was important because it was the first medium that we used to communicate to hackers and show them the hackathon’s theme. In 2020, we focused on adventure. Thus, our new branding had to reflect that theme. Essentially, we wanted to create excitement for the hackathon to get as many applicants as possible. We have always believed in helping beginners break into the tech industry, and by offering them mentorship, guidance and support, we are there to help anyone learn new skills. Of course, we wanted to show them that tech is friendly as well, but also focus on our specialty of segmenting tech into three notable streams: Development, Design and Business. This became a challenge for us as we had to make sure our new branding reflected all the values that StarterHacks stood for.</p>

                    <h1>Research</h1>
                    <hr width=20% align=left>
                    <p class="lead">First off, we conducted some research to see what other hackathons were doing and how they were marketing themselves. This was to ensure that we would create a different appearance for StarterHacks and gain an understanding of what made other hackathons’ branding successful in reflecting their own respective values. This helped us understand our goal for branding on a high level.</p>

                            <div class="col-sm-6">
                                <p class="lead">Next, we began to do many brainstorming sessions to establish the branding. We came up with a variety of ideas, and tried to see how each would look in a “Save the Date” post that announced the hackathon date. We found that many of our early ideas were not scalable to several marketing campaigns or lacked a key aspect of our branding that was crucial to communicate.</p>

                        <p class="lead">However, during the brainstorming process, we used Figma’s comment feature often and it helped us communicate with each other our ideas and thoughts on how to improve the branding as it was being established. This was key in making sure that everyone on the team was working towards the same goal and being honest with each other’s work.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Finally, in a final big brainstorm session, we decided to choose several landmarks around the world (the CN Tower, the Statue of Liberty and Big Ben) and we decided to take some of the elements of these landmarks and transform them into elements of Development, Design and Business respectively. We also supplemented these three landmarks with cute characters to convey the friendly atmosphere to potential hackers. In the end, we received almost 3000 applications and had 1000 hackers attending our event. We were able to collaborate very effectively as a team and create a successful experience for many beginner hackers.</p>
