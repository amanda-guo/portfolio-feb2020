                                            <p class="lead">In November, 2019, I participated in the annual ProdCon Conference held by the University of Waterloo Product Management club. At this conference, we were tasked to come up with a solution to the following prompt:  Microsoft Teams is looking to increase their presence as a tool used by students. As a new Product Manager on Microsoft Teams, how would you design a product/feature to meet this goal? I completed this challenge with a team of 3 other students and we pitched the idea to a panel of judges from Microsoft.</p>

                    <div class="container">
                        <h1>Background and Research</h1>
                        <hr width=50% align=left>
                        <p class="lead">Microsoft Teams is a communication platform that offers chat, meetings, file storage and various other features that facilitates communication in the workplace or across an organization. Our first step to designing a solution for the prompt was to conduct research on the product and our users. We looked at all the features of the application, highlighting the strengths and its potential use among the student population. Although Microsoft Teams is heavily used in the workplace, we felt that this platform would be a great addition to facilitate communication among the members of a club or student organization. It created a unified platform for every member to access. Then, we conducted some research by interviewing students. We asked the following questions to get validate the issue we proposed:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">1. Are you in any clubs? Which ones?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">2. How do you communicate in your club?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">3. What pain points or struggles do you find with your current communication system?</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!--Research Results and Personas-->

                <div class="container">
                    <h1>Research Results and Personas</h1>
                    <hr width=60% align=left>
                    <p class="lead">From these questions, we got good insight into the pain points that students face when considering communications in their clubs. University is a very hectic time for students, and they often struggle to balance schoolwork and extracurriculars. Thus, many feel that it is hard to keep up with communication within their clubs when they are constantly so busy. We divided our target audience into 2 personas: Studious Steven and Passionate Penny.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Studious Steven is a typical Computer Science student who is taking a full course load and still trying to keep up with some clubs. He has strong time management skills, but still finds it hard to go through all the messages in a chat or channel to get to the important information he needs for his clubs.</p>

                    <div class="col-sm-6">

                        <p class="lead">Passionate Penny puts all her focus into clubs and loves to help others grow and thrive. She is the President of various organizations and often has to check messages related to her clubs to stay on top of her duties. She needs an easy way to keep everyone in her organization up-to-date as well.</p>

                <!--Feature Development-->

                <div class="padding">
                    <div class="container">
                        <h1>Feature Development</h1>
                        <hr width=40% align=left>
                        <p class="lead">We realized that there were several pain points that needed to be addressed in our solution. Students were missing important updates, lacked a non-centralized platform to facilitate communication and were constantly overwhelmed by too much information. This helped us come up with the feature that addressed these pain points.</p>
                        <p class="lead">We decided to come up with a Dashboard that is integrated right into Microsoft Teams. This Dashboardâ€™s purpose is to display the top 3 most important updates from all the subcommittees of a student organization. These updates can either be announcements or postings for important documents that are urgent to attend to. We also integrated this Dashboard with other Microsoft products such as Word and Excel, so files can be opened right away through the platform. This way, the information is concise and helps both Studious Steven and Passionate Penny keep up with their clubs. This Dashboard was designed using Figma.</p>
