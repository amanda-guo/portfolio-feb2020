                        <p class="lead">This app was inspired by the universal need, as students, to live on a budget and get tasks (such as grocery shopping) done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Thus, GroceryGo is an Android application that allows users to create their own custom grocery list, and then our system generates a recommendation for the cheapest location for them to buy their groceries in their selected area. We created this project in only 36 hours (and we still managed to find time to sleep as well).</p>

                                <p class="lead">As a team of 4, we each specialized on one area of the application development. My role was mainly front-end development, where I prototyped the UI/UX of the application, and coded the UI on Android Studio. Before any development, we started by discussing the screen flow for the app. We decided to focus on a select few screens that gave users a simple and quick way to key in their information, create their shopping list and let our system tell them the best location to go to. The key focus was creating a simple and quick user experience. This was a key component for me to consider when creating the low fidelity wireframes later on.</p>

                        <p class="lead">I wanted to create a custom and friendly experience for users, thus I chose to use a combination of bright colours together with a sans-serif typography. Furthermore, as with any logos, the goal was to visually communicate the purpose of our application. Thus, I created a vector of a moving shopping cart (since the name is GroceryGo).</p>

                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">Next, I always create low fidelity wireframes to get the placement of each component on the UI, and really focus on the flow from one screen to another. I keep in mind the user's perspective during this stage, as my goal would be to create a cohesive and consistent experience from start to finish for the user. For example, each task the user has to complete is modularized into its own separate screen to keep it simple for each person. Also, we wanted to really personalize this experience as it is each individual's shopping list, so we integrated their name as a variable so it appears later as "Name's Shopping List".</p>
                        <p class="lead">For user testing, I asked various people to try out the prototype of the app, and asked them what they thought about the user experience. I got some feedback on the placement of the buttons, as well as including some valuable information like total estimated price at the end with the recommendation. I iterated on the initial design and produced the following wireframes.</p>

                <div class="padding">
                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="row">
                            <h1>High Fidelity Prototype and Development Integrations</h1>
                            <hr width=95% align=left>
                            <p class="lead">For the high fidelity design, I did some online research to look for best practices on how to best place elements on each screen. I took inspiration from general application login pages and list views. I tested many different placements of the different elements on the screen before coming up with this final design. For example, I used images and component placement to visually show the user going through the shopping experience. The first image shows the user's goal of getting their groceries, then the next screen has a picture of the groceries in a store. This shows the groceries browsing phase as the user types in their information. While they select their items, there is a picture of an empty shopping cart in the background to illustrate that action. Finally, when they get their recommendation, the screen looks like an e-receipt so it shows a final conclusion (and goal) of their shopping trip and experience on our app. Otherwise, I integrated my own minimalist style, and made each button an orange colour so it is visible to the users as the obvious CTA.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I also took over the UI development of this prototype on Android Studio so the actual application that we made from this would appear as I initially designed it. The Github repository for this application can be found at: https://github.com/TheRealJessicaLi/Grocery-Go. Along with the front-end development on Android Studio, this was integrated with our Firebase database to query grocery prices that we had stored there. We used UiPath to map to web pages that display the prices for groceries at individual stores and then dynamically refresh the data for real time updates.</p>
